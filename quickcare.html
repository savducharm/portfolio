            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <p>The goal of this project was to empower a broad demographic of users to easily find the board-certified doctors and specialist they need. I sought to create a user-friendly mobile telehealth application and accompanying desktop site
              that connects users with doctors to schedule virtual appointments and seek immediate medical advice without the hassle and tidium of dealing with insurance, referrals, and visiting multiple offices.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2>The Process</h2>
            <p>For my approach, I followed Design Thinking and Iterative design processes.

              <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
              <p>I started with a competitor analysis to get a better idea of the current market for telehealth apps. I looked at Teladoc, a leading telehealth app in both the Apple App store and Google Play store, and K Health, an up-and-coming
                telehealth app that offers AI medical care that can be followed up by doctor video calls. I created SWOT profiles based on in-depth looks at each competitor's key objectives, overall strategy, and market advantage, marketing
                profile,
                and UX design.

            <div>
              <div>
                <h5>Weaknesses</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li>Despite the ease of accessing doctors from your phone, neither of these apps allow users to talk directly to who they want due to internal vetting systems.</li>
                  <li>Users of these apps often experience long wait times, impatient doctors, and feeling rushed.</li>
                  <li>Apps like K Health come off as cold because they lack human-to-human interaction, especially for older demographics.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <div>
                <h5>Our Soultions</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li>Empower users to access specialized doctors without the need for referrals or multiple visits.</li>
                  <li>Increase access to doctors by allowing users to schedule appointments with who they want, rather than only offering immediate care with on-call doctors.</li>
                  <li>Encourage human-to-human interaction via phone calls, video calls, and direct messaging.
                  <li>
                </ul>
              </div>

          <div>
            <h3>User Research</h3>
            <p>The next step in my process was to get a better idea of people’s experiences around healthcare and telehealth in the U.S. To do this, I conducted both an online survey and in-person interviews.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h4>User Sruveys</h4>
            <p>Goals:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Better understand people’s good points and pain points within the U.S. healthcare system.</li>
              <li>Gauge people’s openness to using tele-health over traditional in-person doctor visits.</li>
              <li>Discover what apps, websites, or other services people use when it comes to healthcare; whether it be Google searching odd symptoms, scheduling a doctor appointment, taking with a 24 hr nurse, or accessing health documents via
                an app.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>I shared the survey with my own personal network, keeping it live for 1 week. During the time it was live, I had a total of 40 responses.</p>

            <p>The survey can be found
              <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd2vAvkgXiJFedHcYA67HIHWSYzcnlOMJ9sUHNT3w-GP2UaBQ/viewform?usp=sf_link">here.</a>
            </p>

            <div>
              <p>Though the survey provided a lot of information, the key takeaways were:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Most people reported only going to the doctor 1-3 times a year. </li>
                <li>The main reason people reported going to the doctor was for flu symptoms, pharmaceuticals prescriptions/refills, injury, and ‘other.’</li>
                <li>Most people felt their co-pay fee was moderately expensive to very expensive and 42.5% stated their fees very often or somewhat often prevented them from seeking health care.</li>
                <li>Over half reported that they were very likely to use a search engine to research illness symptoms.</li>
                <li>About 80% stated they would be somewhat likely or very likely to use a telehealth app.</li>
            </div>

            </div>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h4>User Interviews</h4>
            <p>With the insights I gained from the survey, I put together a set of questions for in-person interviews to learn more about people’s health perceptions and openness to telehealth apps. I interviewed three people, intentionally
              getting people from different ages, genders, and stages in life, for about 30 mins each.</p>

            <p>From these three interviews, the key takeaways were:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>None had tried a telehealth app, but all were open to trying one.</li>
              <li>The process of seeking healthcare is often frustrating and long. From finding a good local doctor, seeking out a specialist, filling out forms, calling to ask a question, etc., the process is not enjoyable.</li>
              <li>The main goal when seeking healthcare is to get a quick diagnostic and immediate, actionable advice to resolve the issue.</li>
              <li>Having a rating system for healthcare professionals and ability to see credentials would be a valuable feature in a telehealth app.</li>
              <li>Being able to share as much information with a doctor via an app is essential. This would include giving doctor access to medical history, vitals, sharing photos, and more.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h4>Affinity Mapping</h4>
          <p>To wrap up the research stage, I took the free responses from my user survey and pulled quotes from my user interviews to create an affinity map. The goal of creating an affinity map was to group together similar experiences,
            needs, wants, and pain points concerning healthcare and telehealth.</p>

          <div>
            <div>
              <h5>Main Insights</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>Participants want a vetting system to determine if they need to see a doctor because seeing a doctor is costly, in terms of both time and money.</li>
                <li>Participants want real care and solutions for effective and efficient treatment as soon as possible from competent professionals.</li>
                <li>Many participants expressed frustration with the process for finding and seeing a specialist.</li>
                <li>Participants want convenience and immediacy when seeking healthcare.</li>
                <li>Participants expressed frustration with finding local, knowledgeable, and available doctors under their insurance plans and within their area.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h5>Feature Insights</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>Participants want an easy to use and easily accessible application.</li>
                <li>Participants want to ensure the doctors they speak to have access to enough information to give an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.</li>
                <li>Participants are willing to pay less than their normal co-pay to use the app.</li>
                <li>Participants want to be able to speak immediately to the right doctor for their needs.</li>
                <li>Participants want access to medical professionals’ credentials and a rating system.</li>
                <li>Overall, participants want to save time and have a more convenient way of getting medical care.</li>

            <h2>Establishing my User Base</h2>
            <p>After the research stage, I had a much better understanding of my users’ wants, needs, pain points, and expectations. With these new insights, I began to create user stories to outline each possible goal my users might have.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <div>
              <h3>Personas</h3>
              <p>After flushing out my user stories, I created personas to make my users come to life. Throughout the design process, I came back to these personas at every step to ensure I was making decisions that would meet their needs.
              </p>
            </div>

            <h3>User Journeys</h3>
            <p>To take a deeper dive into the desires and perspectives of my personas, I created user journey maps.
            </p>
          </div>

              </div>
              <p>Lisa’s journey made clear the hesitation new users may experience when signing up for a new app and learning the process. When designing the user onboarding process, it was my goal to keep it simple and easy.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <div>

              </div>
              <p>Joseph’s journey made me realize how convenient it would be to directly message your doctor without even having the schedule an appointment. I was sure to include this in my design.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <div>

                </picture>
              </div>
              <p>Stephanie’s journey caused me to take into account the importance of trust users will want to be able to establish with the doctors, as well as the app overall. I aimed to design the app with this in mind.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div>
            <div>
              <h3>Task Analysis and User Flows</h3>
              <p>Next, I began to create user flows of critical actions my user would want to complete based on my personas. These allowed me to get a better idea of what my users would need to accomplish their goals.

            <h2>Information Architecture</h2>
            <p>Once I had a more solidified idea of my users and their goals with my user stories, personas, and flows I was then able to begin establishing a sitemap that accounted for the hierarchy and organization of pages.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3>Sitemap</h3>
            <h4>Card Sort</h4>
            <p>To get a better idea of how users would intuitively navigate a telehealth app, I conducted virtual open card sorting with 5 participants who were given 30 cards to sort and name using OptimalSort.</p>
            <p>The resulting similarity matrix and dendrograms showed distinct grouping patterns and possible names for navigation.</p>

            <h2>Wireframes and Iterations</h2>
            <p>With the outline for the app refined and complete, I proceeded with wireframing for the app and desktop versions. I began first with low-fidelity paper and pencil sketches. These were then refined into mid-fidelity wireframes
              and then to a high-fidelity, grayscale, clickable prototype.

            <h2>User Testing</h2>
            <p>Having created high-fidelity, clickable prototypes of the app and desktop versions, the next step was putting the designs to the test with real users.</p>
            <p>The goal of this usability test is to assess the learnability, errors, and satisfaction for new users using QuickCare for the first time. I would like to see if new users are able to navigate, understand, and enjoy using the
              app and its features, such as searching for a doctor, scheduling an appointment, and messaging a doctor.</p>
            <p>The key objectives were to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Determine how easily participants can navigate through the app.</li>
              <li>Observe if completing tasks are intuitive for participants (i.e., searching for a doctor, scheduling an appointment, and messaging a doctor).</li>
              <li>Assess value of the app and to what extent participants enjoyed using it.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I tested 6 participants recruited from my own personal network of friends and family. Participants ranged from early 20s to late 50s to ensure a wide age demographic to fit personas. Each participant tested both the app and
              desktop versions. I alternated versions participants tested first to make sure results were not influenced by previous knowledge.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3>Results</h3>
            <p>I analyzed the data using a Rainbow spreadsheet, task satisfaction ratings, task errors, and other observations.</p>
            <p>Most of the participants found QuickCare easy to use and expressed positive feedback. However, there are critical issues the need to be resolved before launch to ensure users can execute fundamental actions within the app.</p>

              <h5>Actionable Steps</h5>

                <li>Remove doctor’s name on video call and replace it with an icon that pops up the end call and mute mic options</li>
                <li>Add scroll bar on side of screen/window to indicate there is more content</li>
                <li>Changing the name of “Waiting Room” to “Immediate Care”</li>
                <li>Update the information on the onboarding pages to ensure users know this is a telehealth app</li>

            <h2>Further Iterating and Visual Design</h2>
            <p>After testing the functionality of QuickCare and fixing all major usability issues, the next step was to further the visual design of the interface. During this stage, I conducted a user preference test and a peer review, as
              well as consulted iOS Human Interaction Guidelines and established accessibility guidelines.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <div>
              <h3>Preference Testing and Peer Review</h3>
              <p>During the visual design process, I touched base with my users via preference testing to get a better idea of what style to which they were more inclined. Additionally, I reached out to other UX designers for feedback on my
                designs.</p>

            <div>
              <h3>Accessibility Guidelines</h3>
              <p>Once my visual design began to take shape, I consulted the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to ensure accessibility and readability. This step really changed my design and made it more cohesive.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3>Visual Design Process</h3>
              <p>Using grids, Gestalt principles, color theory, and the insights gained from the preference testing, peer review, WCAG, and iOS Human Interaction Guidelines I iterated on my original grayscale wireframes to design the final, polished
                version.</p>

            <h2>Final Design and Conclusions</h2>
            <p>Working on this project was intimidating due to the amount of competition on the market. However, as we as a society come to rely more and more on our technology it is becoming clear that human-to-human contact is becoming a rarity.
              This became apparent once I delved deeper into the needs and concerns of my users. QuickCare sought to bridge the gap between technology and human intimacy by purposefully putting the user at the forefront of each design decision.</p>
            <p>Moreover, creating this app during a pandemic made me see how important telehealth is and will continue to be. For that reason, human-centered design is crucial going forward in this industry.</p>
            <p>Overall, working on this project was eye-opening and enjoyable.</p>
            <p>To see the final, high-fidelity clickable prototype, please click

            </p>
            <p>I would like to give a final thank you to all that helped in the making of QuickCare, especially my tutor and mentor at CareerFoundry who offered invaluable advice and support.</p>
